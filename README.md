## Introduction

The final piece of using _statements_ to control the flow of Ruby execution is
**repetition**. While the **default sequence** requires Ruby to execute top-down,
left to right, we've seen that we can skip chunks of code using the _selection_
statement `if...else...end`. In some ways the reverse of _selection_ is
_repetition_: "Don't move on," we tell Ruby, "do something else until I say
it's OK to move on." The most fundamental _repetition_ construct, present in
pretty much every programming language, is the `while...do...end` loop.

Ruby features other _repetition_ statements, but, for the most part, they're
simplifications on the `while...do...end` statement.

## Define the Basic `while...do...end` Structure

The basic `while...do...end` looks like:

```ruby
while (condition expression) do
 # stuff to do
end
```

As long as the condition expression is `true` (or truthy), the code inside the
`do...end` block will run. Keep in mind, as an _expression_ the condition
expression can be quite rich, using `&&`, `||`, `()`, etc.

## Write an Infinite Loop

Given this definition of `while...do...end`, any truthy expression will make
the loop run forever.

```ruby
while true do
  puts "say this forever..."
end
```

With output:

```text
say this forever...
say this forever...
say this forever...
say this forever...
say this forever...
...
```

Remember truthy? Here it is again:

```ruby
while -1 do # -1 is truthy....
  puts "say this forever..."
end
```

Likewise, falsey is important as well:

```ruby
while nil do
  puts "I will never run"
end
```

## Use Control-C to Break an Infinitely Looping Program

If you ever run a program and it starts printing over and over without end
**or** it never seems to finish **and** you're writing some looping code, you
probably made a mistake and your code is stuck in an infinite loop.

Make sure you're in the terminal spot of the In-Browser IDE, and type
Control-C. That's an old-school UNIX key-combination that means INTERRUPT.
Interrupting a running program will break it out of an infinite loop.

## Terminate a `while...do...end` Loop Naturally

Most loops aren't meant to run infinitely. There's some condition that they
cross, that's captured in the _condition expression_ that tells the
`while...do...end` that it's time is over and it's time to return to the
**default sequence** which will resume after the `end`.

So, somehow we need to create an expression that's true when the `while` begins
(so that the code in the `do...end` runs), but that eventually becomes
false.

Here's a simple example:

```ruby
count = 0 # A bit of data defined outside the loop
while count < 3 do # A Boolean expression using the bit of data
  puts "I am the #{count}, I love to count!" # Work
  count = count + 1 # A bit of work that moves the bit of data closer to being false
end
```

This produces:

```text
I am the 0, I love to count!
I am the 1, I love to count!
I am the 2, I love to count!
```

Let's say we forgot the line `count = count + 1` our _condition expression_
would _always_ be `true` and, therefore, we'd have an infinite loop.

## Use Mutating Assignment Operators (+=, -=, *=, /=)

Let's look back at that previous example to notice how we're moving from a
true or truthy statement to a false or falsey statement. With each loop, the
following expression is evaluated:

```ruby
count = count + 1
```

which slowly moves `count` to a place where it is no longer less than 3, thus
ending the loop.

But writing `count = count + 1` is a bit long-winded (although very clear, sometimes
a few extra keystrokes can save you headaches with debugging if you aren't too
clever about saving a few keystrokes). This pattern of making a change to the thing
that you want to assign to update or "mutate" is very common. Ruby has a shorthand
for this. It's like a contraction in conversation: very few English speakers say
"can not," "have not," or "would not" **all** the time. You're likely to hear them
use _contractions_ (from the Latin: "pulling together") like "can't," "haven't,"
and "wouldn't." So we can link addition and assignment, like above, with:

```ruby
count += 1 # take the value of count, add one to it and then re-assign that result to count
```

Unsurprisingly `-=` does the reverse of `+=`: it does a reduction of the variable's
value and re-assigns it to the variable. Multiplication and division are also supported
`*=` and `/=`. There's even modulo-assignment with `%=`, should you need it!

Try out using these to shorten loops.

## Terminate a `while...do...end` Loop With `break` Statement

Programmers consider it most "expressive" to put the _condition expression_
next to the `while`. Programmers are used to looking to the right of the
`while` to find out why a loop exited. They understand this "why" by
understanding the _condition expression_. **However**, we _can_ break out of a
loop by using the `break` statement.

The `while` should cover the general case including when to repeat **and** when
to finish. A `break` is for priority or anomalous interruption. For example,
most TV or radio stations have a loop of programming that they run every day.
But in the case of a special alert bulletin (dramatic weather, emergency, etc.)
they can "break" out of their regular loop. The `break` statement is like
this.

In the code below, our _general_ intention is to move through the numbers `0`
through `9`. That's what the `while`'s _condition expression_ communicates.
However, there's a little bit of dynamite _inside_ the code. If we _just so
happen_ to hit `magic_exit_number` we break out of the loop.

```ruby
magic_exit_number = 7
count = 0
while count < 10 do
  break if count == magic_exit_number
  puts "I am the #{count}, I love to count!" # Work
  count = count + 1
end
```

Or, imagine you had a random number generator between `0` to `9` (which you'll
learn to make soon). You could assign that random number to `magic_exit_number`
and your repetition would vary between runs of the same program.

Again, another way of writing this that keeps the _condition expression_ all in
one place would be:

```ruby
magic_exit_number = 7
count = 0
while count < 10 && count != magic_exit_number do
  puts "I am the #{count}, I love to count!" # Work
  count = count + 1
end
```

## Your Challenge

Build a `while...do...end` loop that counts from `10` down to `1`, outputting
the current value during each loop. After `1` is displayed, output
`Happy New Year!`. When completed, your code should produce the following:

```sh
10
9
8
7
6
5
4
3
2
1
Happy New Year!
```

Code your solution in `lib/count_down.rb`. Use the earlier examples to put
together a solution and run `learn` to see your progress.

## Solving this Lab

This challenge is a slight modification of the examples we've seen. Instead of
counting up in a loop, we need to count down. First, we'll need to set up the loop:

```ruby
while (condition) do

end
```

Then we will need to set up the loop condition. In our case, we want to output
from `10` down to `1`, so it makes sense here to create a variable, assign it to
`10`, then set the loop to run as long as the variable is greater than or equal
to `1`. In the loop, we will need to subtract `1` from the variable so that the
loop eventually ends.

```ruby
count = 10
while count >= 1 do

  count -= 1
end
```

We've got the loop designed. Now we just need to add the outputs. First, we want
to output the current value of `count` on each loop:

```ruby
count = 10
while count >= 1 do
  puts count
  count -= 1
end
```

Then, since we only need to announce `Happy New Year!` at the end, we can place it
after the loop:

```ruby
count = 10
while count >= 1 do
  puts count
  count -= 1
end
puts "Happy New Year!"
```

Run the tests to confirm your solution then run `learn submit` to submit your
work.

## Conclusion

Congratulations. You know have the `while...do...end` construct as an ally.
With an understanding of _sequence_, _selection_ and now _repetition_ on top of
your experience with expressions, you can write powerful programs! Be sure and
experiment with writing your own loops and don't forget, if your application is
not responding, use Control-C to interrupt the program!
